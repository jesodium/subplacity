Subplacity is a lightweight tool made with Electron that scans Roblox experiences and automatically detects all their subplaces.
No telemetry, no .ROBLOSECURITY, fully private and safe.
It allows for quick joining with a deeplink and copying placeid.

How it works:
1. You put the placeid of the basegame (think Counter-Blox)
2. The program grabs the universeid
3. The program fetches all the places within that universeid.
